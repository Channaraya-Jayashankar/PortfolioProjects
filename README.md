# Covid-19 Data Exploration with SQL ðŸ¦ 

## Project Overview
This project explores a Covid-19 dataset using **SQL** to uncover valuable insights such as infection rates, death percentages, vaccination rollouts, and trends across different countries and continents. The analysis demonstrates advanced SQL skills, including:

- **SQL Joins**
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Temporary Tables**
- **Window Functions**
- **Aggregate Functions**
- **Data Type Conversions**
- **Time-Series Analysis**
- **Anomaly Detection**

This work showcases my ability to clean, analyze, and derive meaningful insights from real-world data using SQL, positioning me as a strong candidate for data analyst roles in the UK market.

## Key Insights
- **Infection & Death Rates**: Calculated the percentage of the population infected and the likelihood of death for Covid-19 cases.
- **Vaccination Trends**: Analyzed vaccination rollouts using **rolling windows** to track the percentage of populations vaccinated over time.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detected unusual spikes in Covid-19 cases using **Z-Scores**.
- **Continental Comparisons**: Analyzed death counts and infection rates across continents for a broader perspective.

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- **Basic Data Exploration**: Inspection of Covid-19 data for initial understanding.
- **Aggregation & Grouping**: Used aggregate functions to calculate total cases, deaths, and other key metrics.
- **Window Functions**: Applied window functions to compute rolling averages for time-series data.
- **Data Normalization**: Converted vaccination data to percentage of population metrics using window functions.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Simplified complex queries by breaking them down with CTEs for more readable and maintainable code.
- **Temporary Tables**: Created and manipulated temporary tables for reusing calculations across multiple queries.

## Conclusion
This project highlights my SQL expertise in data exploration, cleaning, and analysis, all while deriving actionable insights from real-world data. My focus on efficiency, data integrity, and insight generation makes me a valuable asset in any data-driven role.
